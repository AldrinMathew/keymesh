# Keymesh Addon for Blender

This is a clone of the Keymesh Addon repository on Gitlab at: https://gitlab.com/pepe-school-land/keymesh

Pablo Dobarro @pablodp606 is the Developer of this addon. Daniel Martinez does all the Animation and Testing of the addon.

This clone was made because the official repository of Keymesh was not available on Github. I checked on Pablo Dobarro's page and I couldn't find Daniel Martinez on Github. I do not own the content of this repository, and haven't made any changes to the code while initiating the repository.

My changes so far: Added the Python file outside the ZIP file for easier collaboration.
